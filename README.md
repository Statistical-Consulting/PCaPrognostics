# Consulting Project for Fraunhofer IZI

This repository contains files used during the consulting project for Fraunhofer IZI, including data preprocessing, modeling, and visualization of results.

## Code Architecture
ðŸ“Œ *(Placeholder)

## How to Work with This Code

### 1. Data Placement
Before running the code, place the required data files in the `data` folder:
- `Revised_ProstaTrend.Rds` (ProstaTrend-FFPE scores)
- `PCa_cohorts.RDS` (training cohorts)
- `PCa_cohorts_2.RDS` (test cohorts)

### 2. Data Preprocessing
The preprocessing step runs before the rest of the code and generates the necessary CSV files for modeling.

- **Main preprocessing:**  
  Run `preprocessing.R` to preprocess the training cohorts.
- **Additional preprocessing (if required):**  
  Run `preprocessing_2.R` to apply further preprocessing to test cohorts and ProstaTrend-FFPE scores.

### 3. Running the Models
There are two types of model implementations in this repository:

#### **ðŸ“Œ Models Implemented Within This Repository**
Some models are fully implemented within the repositoryâ€™s local structure. These models automatically access the preprocessed CSV files.

To use them:
1. Define the datasets to be used as input.
2. Configure the model hyperparameter grid for tuning or specify the exact parameters for training.
3. The results from nested resampling or the trained model are automatically stored.

ðŸ“Œ *TBD: How to evaluate new data on a model*

#### **ðŸ“Œ Models Implemented in Google Colab (DeepSurv & Cox-PASNet)**
DeepSurv and Cox-PASNet are not included in this repositoryâ€™s folder structure. Instead, they are implemented in Google Colab notebooks to take advantage of GPU performance.

To use these models:
1. Open the respective Google Colab notebook.
2. Upload the necessary files (for tuning, training, or evaluation) into the Colab `content` folder.
3. Execute the required code chunks according to the instructions provided in the notebookâ€™s comments.

### ðŸ’¡ Notes:
- Ensure that all required dependencies are installed before running the code.
- Follow the inline comments in the scripts and notebooks for additional guidance.
